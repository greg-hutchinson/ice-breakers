## Definition
A retronym is a newer name for an existing thing that differentiates the original form/version from a more recent one. 

It is thus a word or phrase created to avoid confusion between two types, whereas previously, no clarification was required.

## Example

* Before disposable diapers came to be they were simply called **diapers**
